<i>You CAN look at it on your phone but to see the screenshots of my spreadsheet, you'd have to turn your phone on its side. But if you look at it on your laptop, you'll see them clear as day. The rest is totally legible whether you're on your laptop or your phone.</i>

<hr>
There's one page for each article JK writes.

So go to <a href="https://537597.xyz">537597.xyz</a> (or click <b><a href="https://537597.xyz">Home</a></b> at the top of any page) and you'll see, for example, "<b>JK 15-16 May 2022</b>". Click on that (or on "<b>READ MORE</b>" under the spreadsheet screenshot) to go to the page for the games that took place from the 15th to the 16th of May.

<hr>
On each page, under "Game 1", "Game 2" etc, is JK's recommended betting angle (including the odds and whether the bet lost $100 or, if it won, how much it returned). I'm pretending we've bet $100 on each game.

Like this:

#### Game 3 | Sunday 2pm
### Leeds vs Brighton

Bet: <b>Leeds to win & under 2.5 Goals</b><br>
Odds: <b>5/1</b> | <b>6.0</b><br><font color="crimson">Lost: <b>$100</b></font>

Next, you'll find his score prediction.

Example:
<style>
.tablelines table, .tablelines td, .tablelines th {
        border: 1px solid black;
        }
td {
    padding-right: 15px;
}
td {
    padding-left: 5px;
}
</style>
|<font color="crimson">JK score prediction</font>|<font color="crimson">1-1</font>|
|Odds|17/2|
|<font color="crimson">Score</font>|<font color="crimson">1-0</font>|
{: .tablelines}

If <b><font color="crimson">the text is red and bold</font></b>, he picked one team to win but the other team won. Big fail.

If <font color="crimson">the text is red but not bold</font>, he got the wrong result but not completely the wrong team - i.e. he predicted a draw but one of the teams won (like the example above) OR he predicted one of the teams would win but it was a draw.

If <font color="green">the text is green but not bold</font>, he got the right result but the wrong score - e.g. he predicted 2-0 but it was 1-0 OR he predicted 1-1 but it was 2-2.

If <b><font color="green">the text is green and bold</font></b>, he nailed the correct score.

<hr>
Next is "What JK said" which just repeats what he wrote in his article but with all the extraneous stuff (links and pictures) removed.

I've made some of the more interesting stuff he wrote <b>bold</b>. Sometimes he suggests other bets that he didn't end up choosing as his betting angle. If those bets ended up winning, they will be bold. It's pretty arbitrary what gets to be bold. It's just meant to draw your eye to certain things in case you're skimming through.

<hr>
Next you get my little summary of how his betting angle got on.

Again, <font color="green">green is good</font>, <font color="crimson">red is bad</font>.

So "<b><font color="green">Maddison (13/2 to score first) did.</font></b>" is green because his betting angle of Maddison to score first (@ 13/2) came in - Maddison did score first.

And "<b><font color="crimson">Wolves 1, Norwich (13/2 to win) 1.</font></b>" is red because his betting angle of Norwich to win (@13/2) lost - Norwich didn't win.

If his betting angle was a double, there may be green text and red text together. So, for example, "<b><font color="crimson">Villa 1, Palace 1. </font><font color="green">Both teams to score </font><font color="crimson">& over 2.5 goals was 6/5.</font></b>" Both teams did score so that part's green, but there weren't over 2.5 goals, hence the red. 

I add in other very simple bits of relevant information from after the match too, in black. For example, if his betting angle was "under 2.5 goals", I'll say what the combined xG of both teams was.

The final score will always be written here too.

<hr>
As far as the spreadsheet screenshots go, don't worry about the colours. All the information's there and you should be able to work out what you're looking at. I'll explain more when I see you if you're interested.

<hr>
PS. As you know (Mick: "He's not pulling up any trees"), this whole thing is a waste of time because it's pretty clear that he's not going to consistently win unless he's lucky.

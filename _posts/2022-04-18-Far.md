## Summary
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-02--summary1.png)  

Good weekend. Nearly doubled his money. Even better if if you dodged the Reguilon injury by waiting to place the bet.

However, what you might notice is that when he tipped the "Liverpool to win and under 3.5 goals" bet, he said the price was 6/4, but in next weeks article (where they say "Any winners last weekend for Jones Knows?") that price has dropped to 11/10. Same with the 10/1 Brighton v Norwich 0-0 draw (now 8/1). The other three winners stayed the same. 

They don't explain it, but I assume the new odds are the official final starting prices on SkyBet. And if you want to get the original price Jones quotes, you better get in there quick.

I didn't notice this at first, and I'm going to keep better track of it from now on.

For now, I've just been keeping track of the revised prices alongside the original prices. I thought it was fair, though, to remove the Reguilon bet from the revised prices, since if you lost out on the longer odds by waiting too long to bet, you'd gain the advantage of knowing Reguilon was injured two days before his match.

So you end up with this little summary depending if you use the prices he quoted in his predictions article or if you use the prices they quoted when they listed the winners next week:

title: Jones Knows's predictions 2nd April 2022
---

### Game 1  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-02--01.png)  

So he has two things going on:  
* First (and what I'm tracking) is the **recommended bet**. This is the **blue text at the bottom** - "Liverpool to win and under 3.5 goals @ 6/4" - and my notes in **red** or **green** depending if he won or lost the bet. He won this one, so my text is green.  
* Second is the **score prediction** in **orange**. He's usually not recommending a bet on these, but I've put a circle round the ones where he's nailed it, as he did here.

### Game 2
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-02--02.png)  

This is one of just a couple of times when he's recommended a bet on the correct score. He won this bet too, so you get a green circle.  

----

### Game 3
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-02--03.png)  

This time, he nailed the correct score again but that wasn't his recommended bet so the score just gets an orange circle to acknowledge his accurate prediction.  

The real issue is the red or green text. He's won again here on Burnley getting more booking points, so the text is green.  

----

### Game 4
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-02--04.png)  

Lost the recommended bet = red text.  

Wrong score prediction = no orange circle.  

----

### Game 5
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-02--05.png)  

Another win for the recommended bet. KWP shots mean it's green text for a win.  

Another orange circle too for the correct score that Jones wasn't recommending we bet on.  

----

### Game 6
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-02--06.png)  

Nailed the Brum derby bookings = green text.  
Wrong score = no orange circle.  

----

### Game 7
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-02--07.png)  

Double fail. Should be clear now.  

----

### Game 8
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-02--08.png)  

Double fail. 

But here's our first "Jones Knows best bet". This is the third thing he does. As well as the recommended bet and the score prediction, he picks one or two special bets nearly every gameweek and assigns points to them for you to bet on. This is the only thing he keeps track of himself and is what Mick was referring to when he said Jones Knows was +65 for the season.  

We don't know how many points he's recommended betting over the season so far, but if it was 3 per gameweek then it would be 90 points so far. Then +65 would be excellent. But I've got no idea if that 90 figure is anywhere near the real amount.

He's not won any of these in the 4 weeks I've been tracking this but in the midweek just gone (19-21 April) he didn't have any "best bets". 

(That red text about Antonio is in red because Jones lost the "recommended bet", not because he lost the "best bet". They're different things.)

### Game 9

If you didn't get the bet on as soon as the Jones Knows article came out, you'd have dodged the Reguilon bet and saved $10. A bit more on that below.

Here are the "recommended bets" winners for this week (blue box) and the "correct score" winners, which I've added in later from the following gameweek's Jones Knows article.

## Summary
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-02--summary1.png)  

Good weekend for Jones Knows. Nearly doubled the stake.  

However, what you'll see below is that although he quoted 6/4 for the Liverpool v Watford bet, in next week's article (where they say "Any winners last weekend for Jones Knows?") that price has dropped to 11/10. Same with the 10/1 Brighton v Norwich 0-0 draw (8/1 in the follow-up post). The other three winners stayed the same. 

They don't explain it, but I assume the new odds are the official final starting prices on SkyBet. And if you want to get the original price that Jones quotes, you better get in there quick.

I didn't notice this at first, and I'm going to keep better track of it from now on.

For now, I've just been keeping track of the revised prices alongside the original prices. I thought it was fair, though, to remove the Reguilon bet from the revised prices, since if you lost out on the longer odds by waiting too long to bet, you'd gain the advantage of knowing Reguilon was injured two days before his match.

So you end up with this little summary depending if you use the prices he quoted in his predictions article or if you use the prices they quoted when they listed the winners next week:

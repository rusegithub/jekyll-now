#### What JK said:
>Roy Hodgson must miss being retired. His side have won just two of their last 22 games in all competitions and have amassed the fewest home points (7) of any team in the top four divisions of English football. In the home defeat to Brentford, Watford became only the third team to lose 10 consecutive top-flight home games in a row, after Birmingham City in February 1986 and Sunderland in August 2005. Burnley have found form and confidence at just the right team. I'd be surprised if Watford can stop them registering another win.

>The increased confidence is absolutely flowing through the feet of Dwight McNeil at the moment, who has looked a player reborn in the wins over Southampton and Wolves. The 22-year-old fell down the pecking order under Sean Dyche after struggling with his form. However, under the new boss Mike Jackson, he has had a look with the man in the mirror and revelled in his position off the right where he can cut in. He has fired six shots at goal in his last two appearances with two of those hitting the target.

>His shots prices are a strong fancy of mine this weekend against arguably the worst team in the Premier League.

>Take your pick on him to have **two (11/10 with Sky Bet)**, three (7/2) or four (10/1) shots on goal or roll with the 6/4 with Sky Bet for him to have at least one shot on target. Also, McNeil has had more shots (42) and more shots on target (12) without scoring than any other player in the Premier League this season. The last player to have more attempts on target without finding the net in a single season was Jes√∫s Navas in 2014-15 (17). He's a big price to score at 13/2.

#### What JK said:
> Since the start of the 18/19 season, Goodison Park is the only Premier League ground Chelsea have visited and taken no points with Everton winning the last three home fixtures against the west Londoners. You're a braver punter than me if you want to back Everton here though.

> The home win did actually tempt me as we have classic case of siding with the team with it all to play for against one that hasn't. Chelsea also seem to be finally feeling the strain of the uncertain atmosphere lingering at the club. This state of flux is allowing some iffy results to creep in.

> However, despite a drop in focus, Chelsea have won eight of their last nine away games in all competitions and it certainly should be nine from nine after their dominant performance at Old Trafford.

> The man at the heart of that showing was Reece James, who was in rampaging form switched back to his attack-minded wing-back role after a few weeks of playing in the back three. When he's on song, Chelsea are a different animal.

> He had the most touches in the opposition box of any Chelsea player in the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford (10) and the most touches overall (113) which showcases just how involved he was. There were also four shots on goal from James to an expected goals return of 0.33. He should have had an assist with Kai Havertz to blame for not converting following a delicious cross.

> "What a player Reece James is," said Roy Keane on his performance.

> "He looks like a boxer. His distribution, movement, strength. He seems like a nice kid too. He's a clever lad, could play in any position. Chelsea are a lucky club to have him. Outstanding."

> With James fully fit, confident and playing against a team likely to be relegated, the England man is a fantastic bet across a variety of markets this weekend. Take your pick from him to have two shots (Evens with Sky Bet), three shots (3/1) and four shots (17/2). But he's more than just a shots merchant, scoring five Premier League goals this season. The 5/1 with Sky Bet on him to bag anytime is a beauty.

#### What JK said:
> Sound the alarm. Harry Kane has now gone 483 minutes without a goal.

> But just when he needs a helping hand, his favourite opponent comes knocking at the door. The deadly frontman has scored more goals against Leicester in the Premier League (16) than any other club in his career, with 12 in his last eight starts.

> The Kane scoring angle is one obviously well found in the market with 14/5 with Sky Bet on him scoring first and 5/6 on the anytime option. But I think we can be more aggressive than that with Spurs capable of running up high scoring wins in their favour under Antonio Conte once getting the first goal (4-0 vs Aston Villa, 5-0 vs Everton, 5-1 vs Newcastle). That has led me to the Kane to score at least twice selection at 9/2 with Sky Bet - something he has done four times in his career vs Leicester.

#### What JK said:
> West Ham and Liverpool are only sides to have scored in every home Premier League game this season with the Hammers scoring in their last 18 league matches at the London Stadium.

> Every run must come to an end though.

> Despite Arsenal's slight wobble of late, their overall defensive process when the axis of Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White and Gabriel play is the best in the Premier League outside Manchester City and Liverpool. They have kept a clean sheet in 13 of their 29 games played together, including in the 2-0 win in the reverse fixture at The Emirates.

> Since West Ham had the welcome addition of the Europa League knockouts to their schedule, their eyes have wandered from their Premier League form - and who can blame them. With the season-defining fixture with Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday, it's easy to see David Moyes resting his key players like Declan Rice and Michail Antonio once again. Plus, with Craig Dawson suspended and Kurt Zouma unlikely to be risked, Moyes has no first-team centre-backs available for selection.

> This is the perfect time for Arsenal to play them and Mikel Arteta's team can win to nil.

#### What JK said:
> It's a sorry situation for Manchester United when the price on an away win for Brentford is as short as 7/2. Thomas Frank's side are now much more than just a bus stop in Hounslow and this is a fixture that they should be relishing. Despite the current state of the Manchester club, winning at Old Trafford for the first time since 1937 would be a momentous moment for the Bees.

> The problem for them is Manchester United have Cristiano Ronaldo.

> Ronaldo moved level with Heung-Min Son to joint second in the Premier League goalscoring charts with his 17th of the season on Thursday, earning United a 1-1 draw with Chelsea. You can rest assured, he has eyes on Mohamed Salah, who is five away. He'll be on penalties, surely.

> The 37-year-old has scored eight of United's last nine goals, including match-winning hat-tricks against Tottenham and Norwich, in an emphatic response to criticism that came his way earlier in the season during a run of one goal in 10 games. Sometimes the most obvious play is the savvy play. Just back Ronaldo to score twice at 9/2 with Sky Bet.

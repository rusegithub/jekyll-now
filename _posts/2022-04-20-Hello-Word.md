*$10 returns*: **$27**  
Willock not in squad. Knee injury on Friday so we probably dodged the bet  

*Score prediction*: **2-1**  
*Score*: **1-0**


`Eddie Howe has only lost one of his 10 Premier League home matches with that solitary defeat coming at the hands of Manchester City. The atmosphere at St James' Park and around the club in general is certainly creating a tough environment forvisiting teams. Three straight defeats have stalled their progress towards safety but all of those setbacks came on the road. A return to home comforts on Friday night under the lights should see them snap that losing run.`

`Joe Willock is a player who has landed us a couple of touches this season and his goalscorer prices with Sky Bet remain juicy enough to attack again.`

`Eddie Howe has found the perfect role for Willock in this system where he can utilise his clever runs into dangerous areas. It's taking him into great positions which has rocketed his shots per game and expected goals average. Since mid-January, he leads the way for Newcastle for shots (21), expected goals (2.47) and goals (2 - joint with Ryan Fraser and Fabian Schar). With Chris Wood woefully out of form, scoring one goal in his last 17 starts for Burnley and Newcastle, Willock is Newcastle's most likely route to goal. That makes his price of 6/1 with Sky Bet to score anytime rather silly.`

#### What JK said:
>Eddie Howe has only lost one of his 10 Premier League home matches, with that solitary defeat coming at the hands of Manchester City. The atmosphere at St James' Park and around the club in general is certainly creating a tough environment for visiting teams. Three straight defeats have stalled their progress towards safety but all of those setbacks came on the road. A return to home comforts on Friday night under the lights should see them snap that losing run.

>Joe Willock is a player who has landed us a couple of touches this season and his goalscorer prices with Sky Bet remain juicy enough to attack again.

>Eddie Howe has found the perfect role for Willock in this system where he can utilise his clever runs into dangerous areas. It's taking him into great positions which has rocketed his shots per game and expected goals average. Since mid-January, he leads the way for Newcastle for shots (21), expected goals (2.47) and goals (2 - joint with Ryan Fraser and Fabian Schar). With Chris Wood woefully out of form, scoring one goal in his last 17 starts for Burnley and Newcastle, Willock is Newcastle's most likely route to goal. That makes his price of 6/1 with Sky Bet to score anytime rather silly.

#### What JK said:
>The results of last week's betting angles and predictions were profitable but in typical style, the chosen angle that was used as the headline let us down. "Sancho to star in a Man Utd win" was all sorts of wrong with United - and Sancho in particular - turning in a performance that once again sent out alarm bells ringing for the problems behind the scenes at the club.

>Up until last weekend, Sancho had been growing in confidence and showing signs of the player we all saw at Borussia Dortmund. I'm willing to forgive him for that bad day at the office and remain convinced he is overpriced in an array of markets involving his performance. The bet that stands out here is his first goalscorer price of 9/1 with Sky Bet.

>Everton are a very flaky unit defensively and although you can't argue with Jonjoe Kenny's application and enthusiasm levels, question marks remain about his ability as a Premier League defender. He'll be tasked with keeping a lid on Sancho and that looks a battle the United winger can win.

#### What JK said:
>Monday evening's poor outing at Crystal Palace for Arsenal - one I watched first-hand at Selhurst Park - wasn't a performance I had seen coming. But a closer inspection of their attacking numbers of late does paint a picture that perhaps Arsenal have been overperforming since the turn of the year.

>Their troubles are highlighted by the fact they have failed to score a single goal from non-set piece scenarios in their last four matches, dating back to March 6. What is in their favour here is that one goal probably will be enough to beat Brighton, who have failed to score in six of their last seven Premier League matches. However, Arsenal at odds-on against such a well-coached side like the Seagulls just isn't something I want to invest in. I'll play the draw.

>One player that has quietly slipped under the radar this season for Brighton is Alexis Mac Allister. Much of Brighton's dynamic play through the centre come via Mac Allister's crisp and creative passing. His performances have reached another level over the past two months to such an extent he started his first match for Argentina in their World Cup qualifier with Venezuela.

>That experience should only further enhance his authority in midfield for Brighton and he looks overpriced to find the scoresheet at The Emirates. Since scoring a double at Everton in January, he has gone 847 minutes without a goal, but he has been peppering the opposition goal with quality strikes. No player in the Premier League without a goal in that period has managed more shots on goal than Mac Allister (25) with seven of those coming in the 0-0 draw with Norwich. On another day he could have had a couple of goals to his name as two of those efforts were just a whisker away. He has the quality to punish Arsenal if they afford him space to shoot.

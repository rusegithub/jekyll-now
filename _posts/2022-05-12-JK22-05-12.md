#### What JK said:
> A Liverpool victory is the most likely outcome here but Aston Villa do have the defensive capabilities to make this a tricky task.

> Since Steven Gerrard was appointed in November, Aston Villa have consistently posted top-six standard defensive displays. Their expected goals against data has them averaging 1.04 goals conceded per 90 minutes which has them as the fourth-best defence in that metric over a 23-game period. An impressive feat from Gerrard and his defensive block gave Jurgen Klopp's team plenty of problems in the reverse fixture that was won courtesy of a Mohamed Salah penalty.

> With such two sturdy defences on show in this game and Klopp's men in 'job done mode', there is plenty of juice in backing Liverpool to win a low-scoring encounter. An angle we have exploited nicely in recent weeks in wins over Watford and Newcastle.

> Six of their last eight Premier League wins have seen the Liverpool win and under 2.5 goals selection cop - all at prices bigger than 5/2. It's 100/30 with Sky Bet to go in again. That will do for me.

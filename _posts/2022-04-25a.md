#### What JK said:
>I am always drawn to the Brighton shots market when they take on one of the Champions League chasers as the markets tend to underestimate their lines.

>In nine fixtures against the 'big six' this season, Graham Potter's team have averaged 12.1 shots per 90 minutes, playing with their usual adventure and bravery albeit without much clinical edge. But it's this lack of clinical edge that means they are always chasing the game which has a huge effect on their need to get shots away at goal.

>Although I do not see them having enough quality to get a result in the match market, it's a case of take your pick from the Brighton players with Leandro Trossard (4/5 with Sky Bet), Enock Mwepu (4/5), Danny Welbeck (4/5) and Lewis Dunk (7/2) all eye-catching plays to register two shots or more.

>He has been peppering the opposition goal with strikes. No player in the Premier League without a goal in the last six games has managed more shots on goal than Mac Allister (25) with seven of those coming in the 0-0 draw with Norwich. As long as he starts in his usual position just off the striker, he's in a great spot to have two or more shots at goal.
